		        			the borders of grains, we can add inclusions, or mixed types of algorithms (Monte Carlo and cell automata).

		        			we made QuadTree algorithm which was based on recursion. In this project I used Java and C#. <br/> <br/>

		        			and environment - we worked in Ruby with WebSocket. The aplication consisted of two parts - Client and Server. Client sends 
		        			simple program to server, and there the program is run and its correctness is checked.

		        			connect all parts of work. Link to the result is below: <br/>
